# 🛒 E-commerce Web Application

This is a modern and interactive e-commerce landing page design built with React for the front-end and Express.js with SQLite for the back-end APIs.  
The project features dynamic product sections like campaigns, recommendations, and electronic deals, fetching data via RESTful APIs. Redux is used to track recently visited products, enhancing user experience.
